                PGP.ASC: DECENTRALIZING AND STANDARDIZING PGP KEY STORAGE<br>
                --
                </div>


                <div id="post">
                <p>I recently came across a new project which aims to standardize how we get hold of PGP keys, decentralizing the process and adding alternatives to centrally controlled keyservers. It&#39;s called pgp.asc [http://pgpasc.org] and it was created by developer Max Stoiber.</p>

                <p>The basic idea is that people who have websites can generate their own PGP keys and then place their pulic key as a file called pgp.asc in their root folder (e.g.http://domain.com/pgp.asc). That&#39;s it! It may sound incredibly simple - and it is - but I think it adds a pretty cool way to decentralize how we obtain keys. It&#39;s not 100% foolproof, but this is just a start. It adds an easy way (especially for beginners) to get into the world of mail encryption and provides a standard way to find keys. Of course there is a chicken and egg problem with new initiatives like this, but I hope this one gets off the ground and becomes widely used.</p>

                <p>Here&#39;s a short interview with Max, where I asked him about the project and what he thinks about the importance of PGP.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">THE INTERVIEW</p>

                <p>[N-] What made you come up with the idea for pgp.asc?</p>

                <p>[MS] It was a mixture of learning more and more about PGP and starting to use it, and absolutely loving the humans.txt initiative. Combine those two, and you have pgp.asc!</p>

                <p>[N-] Have you had many people using it so far?</p>

                <p>[MS] As you can see in our Hall of Fame [http://pgpasc.org/halloffame.html] there is 12 people in there, but I am pretty sure the actual number is much higher.</p>

                <p>[N-] Why do you think it&#39;s important for people to use PGP encryption?</p>

                <p>[MS] A nice metaphor is, that PGP is basically envelopes for digital mail. Nobody sends physical mail without an envelope, nobody should read it except the recipient. That&#39;s exactly what PGP does, but it&#39;s more of a Fort Knox than an envelope.</p>

                <p>[N-] How do you feel about the apathy from the public about privacy in general? How do you think we can persuade others that using PGP is a good for them?</p>

                <p>[MS] I think it&#39;s mostly the tools, which are absolutely horrendous to use. I read a quote somewhere which I think sums it up quite well:</p>

                <p>Security people should start hanging out with Usability people.</p>

                <p>[N-] I totally agree. For those who haven&#39;t set up their own pgp key, what&#39;s the easiest way you&#39;ve found to do it?</p>

                <p>[MS] I&#39;ve just finished our basic PGP Guide for beginners, which should be on the website soon! You can find the current version right here: [https://github.com/mstoiber/pgp.asc/issues/5]</p>

                <p>[N-] Are there any future developments youre thinking of adding to the project?</p>

                <p>[MS] We are just getting started, I have a very long roadmap. Right now the focus is making a nice website and getting the copy perfect, while simultaneously building a nice backend for the Hall of Fame. (We need designers/copywriters! Are you interested in encryption and want to help? Come and join the discussion at [https://github.com/mstoiber/pgp.asc]!)</p>

                <p>I then plan on adding a big &quot;Beginners Section&quot; for people who have never heard of PGP before, and then maybe even an advanced section, with tutorials about more elaborate ways to distribute your key. (E.g. Namecoin, Keybase, DNS,…) I&#39;d also really like a page that focusses on the surrounding elements, e.g. your network, your PC,… (Basically what Curtis Wallens PGP Guide touches on: [http://curtiswallen.com/pgp])</p>

                <p>[N-] Where can people go to find out more info on the project?</p>

                <p>[MS] Currently, most of the information and discussion is on Github: [https://github.com/mstoiber/pgp.asc]</p>

                <p>[N-] Thanks for taking the time Max. I think all of you should go to the Github link above and also check out [http://pgpasc.org] and start using the new standard today! Let&#39;s help get this initiative off the ground.</p>
