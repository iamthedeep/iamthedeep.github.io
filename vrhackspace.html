                COULD WE MAKE A VIRTUAL REALITY HACKSPACE? (#VRHACKSPACE)<br>
                --
                </div>


                <div id="post">
                <p>This video is based on a recent blogpost by concreted0g, in which he had a great idea for a virtual reality hackspace. With his permission, I want to talk about and expand on some of those ideas and see what you all think.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">SIMULATED TOOLS</p>

                <p>The first thing that concreted0g suggested is how we could emulate tools such as 3D printers, mills and lathes, so we can simulate our projects in 3D space, test them out and get feedback.</p>

                <p>With tools like the newly released VR desktop, collaboration in VR space is potentially possible.</p>


                <p class="subtitle">THE ULTIMATE HACKER HANGOUT</p>

                <p>VR has so much potential to bring people together, especially those in far-flung places around the world. I could see a VRhackspace being kind of like The Black Sun hangout in Snowcrash, a place where hackers, makers and tinkerers can congregate, work on projects, learn, and have fun together.</p>

                <p>Since there&#39;s mo need to follow the same physical constraints of meatspace, the hackspace could be impossibly big - filled with the most interesting people, and perhaps even a few AI bots too.</p>

                <p>There could be events, hackathons, talks and everything would be accessible 24/7.</p>


                <p class="subtitle">A GLOBAL FACTORY</p>

                <p>Most people don&#39;t have access to the different types of 3D printers, mills, lathes etc, so what if we could crowdsource the use of these machines, and create a global distributed factory?</p>

                <p>People who want to share their tools, could become part of the system and allow other users to take their simulated projects and make them real.</p>

                <p>A marketplace could exist where users choose to send their projects to machines, based on price and/or location.</p>

                <p>Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin could be used for both authorization and payments, and cheap computers like the raspberry pi could automate the production process. Members could even choose to give free access to their tools if they want to.</p>


                <p class="subtitle">GET INVOLVED</p>

                <p>Obviously this is very early stage, but I think there is a lot potential here. If you&#39;d like to explore these ideas and get the project going, you can get in touch with @concretd0g on twitter. We&#39;ve also started the hashtag #VRhackspace, so use that if you want to take part in the discussions.</p>

                <p>Anyways, thanks for watching, and I look forward to seeing what you all think.</p>
