                THE ZAMEK HARDWARE PASSWORD MANAGER (EARLY LOOK)<br>
                --

                <div id="post">
                <p>The Zamek is an open source hardware project, aiming to create a secure, digital, password manager that you can throw in your pocket along with your keys.</p>

                <p>The project is still in development, and I wanted to say thank you to Jarek for sending me this early beta version. Let&#39;s have a look at it.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">DESIGN</p>

                <p>Like I mentioned, this an early version of the board, and the final thing may change. Of course, there will be a plastic case for the consumer version.</p>

                <p>Besides that, you&#39;ll notice it looks like a standard USB dongle, but with a few extra components.</p>

                <p>For starters, there&#39;s a super bright mini OLED display with a resolution of 128x32 pixels, allowing for 4 lines of text.</p>

                <p>On the end you&#39;ll find a very handy mini trackball button that&#39;s used for interacting with the device. This feels great, and is much better than joystick buttons for fast scrolling.</p>

                <p>Unlike many of the other password managers out there, the Zamek has its own power source too, thanks to a little lipo battery. This addition alone makes it way more useful.</p>

                <p>The underside contains most of the components, including an ATMega32u4 processor, flash chip, and charging circuit. There&#39;s also another button here, which is used for reseting the device.</p>


                <p class="subtitle">USAGE</p>

                <p>Press down on the trackball to turn on the device. You then enter you&#39;re PIN using the trackball to scroll through the numbers.</p>

                <p>The cool thing about this process is that it&#39;s deterministic, so you don&#39;t have to set a PIN, or even have a single account. You can enter any PIN from 1 to 16 digits long, and gain access.</p>

                <p>Jarek tells me that he&#39;s hoping to add more entropy to the process, perhaps by using the trackball when you first turn on the device.</p>

                <p>Once you&#39;re in, you&#39;ll see that the 20 entries are already pre-filled with gibberish data.</p>

                <p>You can then go through the entries, manually changing them to what you want. You can add passwords that are 16 characters long, and there&#39;s an option to use the psuedo-random number generator to generate your own on the device. These passwords are encrypted and stored on a separate EEPROM chip on the board.</p>

                <p>There is also an app in development that lets you do all this via a desktop interface if you want. There&#39;s an option to create an encrypted backup here too.</p>

                <p>One cool feature is when you want to use a password, you can either type it in manually, or alternatively, you can plug the Zamek into a USB port, press the button, and it auto types it out for you.</p>


                <p class="subtitle">FOLLOW THE PROJECT</p>

                <p>You can follow the development of the device by checking out the Hackaday project page.</p>

                <p>Once the final versions of the hardware and software are finished, Jarek tells me all the code and schematics will be available on this page too.</p>

                <p>https://hackaday.io/project/3555-zamek-the-offline-pocket-password-manager</p>

                <p>Also, if you&#39;d like to be notified of when the Zamek is available to buy, a CrowdSupply page has been set up.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">CONCLUSION</p>

                <p>This is my favourite hardware password manager that I&#39;ve used so far. The big plus for me is its ability to work completely offline and airgapped from any other computers.</p>

                <p>Before the final version, it&#39;d be nice to see some additions. Some kind of manual backup process that is completely offline would be good. Other than that, some nice-to-haves would include longer passwords, perhaps even storing things like GPG keys. Also, extra settings, like being able to flip the screen orientation, and maybe a battery charging indicator.</p>

                <p>What do you all think of the Zamek? Leave your comments below. If you&#39;ve got any other ideas for similar devices you think I should cover, let me know too. Thanks for watching.</p>
