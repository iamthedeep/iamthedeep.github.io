                <p>Welcome to Cyber Dump number 9, your weekly round up of techno-weenie bullshit. As always, all source links are in the description.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">SINGLE BOARD COMPUTING</p>

                <p>It’s not been long since the Raspberry Pi Zero was released, and the foundation have been at it again. This time they released the Raspberry Pi 3, with long awaited features like built-in wifi and bluetooth, as well as a faster CPU and GPU. It’s available now and, surprisingly is the same price as the previous RPi2.</p>

                <p>- https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-3-on-sale</p>

                <p>In other RPi news, youtube user Wermy uploaded a really cool mod, creating a little games console inside an Altoids tin, using a Pi Zero and a hacked up DS Lite Controller. Really cool idea, and I’d definitely like to try something similar.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">FAST FOOD</p>

                <p>McDonalds are getting in the VR game. You too can create your own budget VR headset using a Happy Meal box. Just fold it up, add the included lenses, then your smartphone and you’re good to go. Currently it seems to only be available in Sweden. I know people are shitting on this, but I think it’s kinda cool, even though it is probably covered in grease, and stinks of fries.</p>

                <p>- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnYg752URcE</p>

                <p>Dominos has basically created the Deliverator’s pizza vehicle from SnowCrash. The DXP comes with its own pizza oven, although there’s no countdown timer, and no word on what Domino’s kingpin Uncle Enzo will do to you if you don’t deliver on time.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">AUGMENTED REALITY</p>

                <p>Meta have announced v2 of their augmented reality headset, aptly named Meta 2. Touted as the most immersive augmented reality on the planet, this headset boasts a high res display, with wide viewing angles, along with some pretty cool hand gesture features.</p>

                <p>The dev kit is available for $949 and ships near the end of 2016.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">ROBOTICS</p>

                <p>Earlier this week, Steve Jurvetson captured a moment between one of mans furry friends and one of Boston Dynamic’s four legged beasts. I thought this was an interesting moment since the dog seemed to think the robot was perhaps alive, and I’m guessing interactions like this are only going to get stranger in the future.</p>

                <p>Zhe Xu and Emanuel Todorov released a paper and video detailing their designs for a highly biomimetic robot hand. This design uses fairly simple means to create the hand, but the results and operability are very realistic.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">VIDEOS</p>

                <p>Two cool drone related videos this week. The first is by Youtube User MetallDanny, and features some awesome drone racing in what looks to be an underground carpark in Rotterdam, Holland.</p>

                <p>- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDKS7Lyw3Yw</p>

                <p>The next is an amazing DIY video by Samm Sheperd, showing how he made a fully functional Mini Flying Wing. This one is definitely recommended.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">THIS WEEK ON NODE</p>

                <p>This week there’s two more software guides. The first shows you probably the easiest way to hide secret messages inside image files using steganography.js, and the second is a great little app which allows you to download videos and audio from many places on the web.</p>

                <p>As always, if you have comments, ideas or suggestions, leave them below . Thanks for watching, and see you next week.</p>
