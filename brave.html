                BRAVE: POTENTIALLY THE BEST MODERN WEB BROWSER?<br>
                --
                </div>


                <div id="post">
                <p>A few weeks ago I mentioned that Brave, the open source, privacy focused browser had been announced. Well, yesterday I received an email from their mailing list telling me that the developer builds have been released, so I thought I&#39;d make a video testing out this early version.</p>

                <p>It&#39;s currently available on all platforms, so Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android versions are availble, and you can find it at brave.com</p>

                <p class="subtitle">INTERFACE</p>

                <p>Brave has quite a minimal interface. It follows the standard UI patterns of most browsers, with address bar, navigation and bookmarking at the top, and tabs below.</p>

                <p>One thing that I like, is when you browse to a website, the address bar automatically hides, and is replaced by the title of the current tab. It also shows the loading speed for each site.</p>

                <p>Another cool feature is how you can quickly hover over tabs to see what&#39;s inside them - pretty handy if you have lots of tabs open. It even previews videos that are playing, seemingly without any effect on performance.</p>


                <p class="subtitle">PRIVACY</p>

                <p>One of the main selling points of Brave is its privacy focus. It comes with a few built in features that you usually need to add manually to other browsers. You&#39;ll notice them in the Bravery menu.</p>

                <p>By default the browser runs https everywhere, which tries to redirect to an encrypted version of a site if it&#39;s available. Annoying popups are blocked, as well as third party cookies that are used to track you.</p>

                <p>Another cool feature is built-in ad-blocking. You have the option to block ads completely, or use the still in development feature which replaces ads with options to directly pay content creators using bitcoin. I&#39;m curious to see how this will develop, and if it will eventually allow content creators to move away from advertising as a business model.</p>


                <p class="subtitle">PERFORMANCE</p>

                <p>I used browserbench.org to do a couple of tests against Firefox. It&#39;s worth noting that I had some extensions running in Firefox that do similar things to what Brave can, so add-ons like https everywhere, third party tracking blockers etc to try and make it more comparable.</p>

                <p>The JetStream benchmark, which tests the loading speeds against a wide range of Javascript applications put Brave slightly ahead with a score of 98.292 to Firefox&#39;s 96.269</p>

                <p>- http://browserbench.org/JetStream/</p>

                <p>Brave came out quite a bit faster on the Speedometer test, which simulates the speed at which the browser can handle user interaction. Brave scored 52.9 to Firefox&#39;s 30.6</p>

                <p>- http://browserbench.org/Speedometer/</p>

                <p>Obviously this isn&#39;t conclusive, but anecdotally, it feels faster. You especially notice the difference, when it&#39;s loading Youtube, or say a news site, with lots of content.</p>


                <p class="subtitle">CONCLUSION</p>

                <p>Brave is still very much in development, but this early version is extremely promising. I&#39;d love to see features that mimic NoScript functionality, along with more control of privacy options, but other than that, Brave is already very solid and fast. I&#39;m definitely looking forward to seeing what&#39;s next for the browser.</p>

                <p>Have any of you tested this yet? What did you think? Leave your comments below, thanks for watching.</p>
