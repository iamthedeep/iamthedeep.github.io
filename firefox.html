                HOW TO SET UP FIREFOX FOR SECURITY/PRIVACY<br>
                --
                </div>


                <div id="post">
                <p>This little guide will show you how to set up Firefox for greater privacy and security.Obviously this isn&#39;t exhaustive, but it should be a good start.</p>

                <p>I&#39;m using Firefox, because I think it&#39;s currently the most privacy friendly browser due to it&#39;s open source nature and the fact that it isn&#39;t owned by a big data-mining corporation, like Chrome and Safari are.</p>

                <p>Quick shout out to the people on twitter who gave suggestions, and all links mentioned are below.</p>

                </p>


                <p class="subtitle">DEFAULT SEARCH ENGINE</p>

                <p>The first thing to do is change your default search engine. I chose DuckDuckGo.com because it is open source, and doesn&#39;t track users at all. It&#39;s pretty cool, and has it&#39;s own image search as well. There&#39;s even a working Javascript free version.</p>

                <p>- https://duckduckgo.com</p>


                <p class="subtitle">REMOVE FLASH</p>

                <p>Unless you have a very specific need for flash to be on your system, I would remove it completely. Just do a search for news of flash exploits and you will see how much of a security risk it is.</p>

                <p>Youtube and other sites have been transitioning over to HTML5 alternatives for some time now, so it&#39;s not that big a deal.</p>


                <p class="subtitle">NOSCRIPT</p>

                <p>The NoScript add-on allows you to specify which sites can run scripts in your browser, and by default, blocks everything. The goal is to stop both malicious and tracking scripts from interacting with your system at all. When you first use it you&#39;ll be surprised by how many scripts are running on some sites. There are lots of extra options to drill down into if you want, and I highly recommend using this.</p>

                <p>- https://noscript.net<br>
                - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/</p>


                <p class="subtitle">RANDOM AGENT SPOOFER</p>

                <p>When you visit websites, you are automatically sending data about your computer. This includes your browser, it&#39;s version number, your operating system and what version it is, your screen resolution, language, the fonts on your system, and more, and this information is used to fingerprint and track you. This add-on randomly changes your user agent as often as you wish, making it a little harder to passively track you. It also has a tonne of other options to protect your privacy.</p>

                - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/random-agent-spoofer/</p>


                <p class="subtitle">UBLOCK ORIGIN</p>

                <p>uBlock Origin is an ad-blocker which automatically blocks different ads while you browse. Aside from most ads being annoying, the fact is that they also track your movements on the web.</p>

                <p>There are other ad-blockers out there too, so have a look for yourself. Most also have a whitelisting feature giving you the option to support certain sites.</p>

                <p>- https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/</p>


                <p class="subtitle">PRIVACY BADGER</p>

                <p>Similar-ish to an ad-blocker, but more robust is Privacy Badger by the EFF. This add-on checks to see if third party servers are tracking you through cookies or canvas fingerprinting, and gives you the option to block them.</p>

                <p>For example, anyone can embed a Facebook â€˜like&#39; button on their website, and since they are so widely used, every time you visit a site with one, Facebook indirectly knows almost every site you use. This add-on blocks that.</p>

                <p>Again, this can be used on a site by site basis, so you can decide what you want to allow and what to block. It&#39;s also worth noting that the add-on Ghostery is also good and works in a similar way.</p>

                - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger-firefox/</p>


                <p class="subtitle">HTTPS EVERYWHERE</p>

                <p>Finally we have HTTPS Everywhere, another add-on by the EFF. This one automatically checks whether every site you visit has an SSL encryption certificate, and if so, takes you to the HTTPS version of the website. The goal is to ensure that your browsing is encrypted, so passive snoopers can&#39;t see the actual content of what you&#39;re looking at.</p>

                - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/https-everywhere/</p>


                <p class="subtitle">CONCLUSION</p>

                <p>You can check out the Panopticlick to see how safe your browser is against tracking.</p>

                <p>Again, this guide only provides the basics, and you could go further with things like multi-hop VPNs and TOR, but those involve more complex ideas like trust and information security that are a little outside the scope of this video. However, if you&#39;re doing your daily browsing or whatever, these steps should add a few more layers of security and privacy.</p>
