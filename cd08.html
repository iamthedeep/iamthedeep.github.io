                <p class="subtitle">LINUX MINT HACKS</p>

                <p>The Linux Mint site announced they&#39;d been hacked this week. Anyone who downloaded the latest ISO on February 20th are advised to wipe their system, since it appears backdoors had been inserted.</p>

                <p>The forum was also hacked, so change your password as soon as possible.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">PASSPHRASE</p>

                <p>I saw a link to this cool open source web app called Passphrase. You pick a long passphrase, write your message, then everything is encrypted locally in the browser, then uploaded to the passphrase server.</p>

                <p>To get the message back at a later date, just insert the same long passphrase.</p>

                <p>- https://passphrase.io</p>


                <p class="subtitle">FREE INFORMATION</p>

                <p>Last October, artists covertly 3D scanned the famous bust of Egyptian Queen Nefertiti in Berlin, and recently they released the hi-res 3d data to the world, allowing anyone to make their own busts.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">DRONES</p>

                <p>DARPA&#39;s Fast Lightweight Autonomy program has been developing quadcopters that can fly unaided, without communication to operators or GPS, at speeds up to 20 meters per second.</p>

                - nextbigfuture.com/2016/02/darpa-developing-truly-autonomous.html</p>

                <p>On a related note, James Higgins recently uploaded a video of what he calls his UAV airsoft gunship, basically a quadcopter that remotely shoots an airsoft gun. Equals parts silly and awesome.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">WIRELESS</p>

                <p>Researcher Mark Newlin has discovered a vulnerability which effects a huge chunk of wireless mice and keyboards. He found that the data between the dongle and peripheral is often not encrypted, meaning malicious keystrokes can be injected, basically opening up computers for all sorts of abuse.</p>

                <p>- http://www.pcworld.com/article/3036739/mobile-security/widespread-wireless-mouse-keyboard-flaw-lets-hackers-use-your-pc-from-afar.html</p>

                <p>In other Wifi news, researchers at the University of Washington have developed a passive wifi system that uses 10,000 times less power than standard wireless. It allows for super lower power wifi beacons to be attached to all sorts of devices, opening up the so-called internet of things in ways we hadn&#39;t imagined before.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">DIY</p>

                <p>Terence Eden took probably the worlds worst invention, the selfie stick, and turned it into something pretty cool. He basically took the cheapest $2 bluetooth selfie sticks and repurposed them to initiate Linux commands whenever the button was pressed.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">VIDEOS</p>

                <p>The first video this week is a recent talk by Demis Hassabis, one of the founders of Googles DeepMind. He gives an overview of artificial intelligence, what DeepMind have been up to, and what&#39;s coming in the future.</p>

                <p>- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fjmnOQuqao</p>

                <p>The next video is a cyberpunk short film called Lost Memories 2.0, and it deals with augmented reality, artificial memories, AI and more. This one is not safe for work.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">THIS WEEK ON NODE</p>

                <p>Two software videos this week. The first is an overview of Datt, a cool project that&#39;s trying to reinvent distributed social networking and more, and the second vid is a quick overview of the newly released Brave Browser.</p>

                <p>As always, stay tuned for more next week. I&#39;ve also got something very exciting to show you in a couple of weeks or so, but more on that later! Thanks for watching.</p>

                <p>- Datt https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjMIeio_qfY<br>
