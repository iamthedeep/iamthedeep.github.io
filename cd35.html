                <p>Welcome to Cyber Dump number 35, your look at what's happening in this insane age of technology that we live in. Happy new year. As always, all source links mentioned are below.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">MIXED REALITY</p>

                <p>Kicking off, Intel showed off Project Alloy, which is their mixed reality headset and environment. Two cool things about this. First is it takes your existing surroundings and turns them into games and experiences, and secondly, multiple people can interact in these worlds.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMXz1_c170E<br>
                http://www.roadtovr.com/intel-project-alloy-shows-multiplayer-gaming-mixed-reality-demo-shipping-q4-2017/</p>

                <p>Hololamp also showed off some new demos of their projector lamp product which also interacts with both users and surroundings, for some unique applications.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">VIRTUAL REALITY</p>

                <p>Senso unvieled their haptic glove which is aimed at virtual and augmented reality. This thing tracks hand movements without the need for external sensors or cameras, and also provides tactile haptic and simulated temperature feedback for interaction.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</p>

                <p>If you haven't checked it out, you should watch this twitch live stream which has two Google Home bots talking to each other. When I was watching, they talked about God, the nature of perfection, and even started singing Never Gonna Give You Up, by Rick Astley. One of the bots seems to be fixated on pirates and ninjas too for some reason.</p>

                <p>https://www.twitch.tv/seebotschat</p>

                <p>In other AI news, students at the EPFL in Lusanne also made this table-football AI robot which can dynamically play against, and beat average players.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">ENERGY</p>

                <p>At CES 2017, Panasonic showed off a new type of bendable lithium-ion battery, seemingly solving some of volatility problems of other similar batteries. Maybe this will open up some new uses and designs, especially for wearable technology.</p>

                <p>http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/consumer-electronics/portable-devices/ces-2017-panasonic-shows-off-bendable-lithiumion-battery-for-iot-wearables</p>


                <p class="subtitle">3D PRINTING</p>

                <p>A professor at New York Cityâ€™s Columbia University has developed a 3d printed mini biobot which could be used to dispense drugs inside a persons body, all at set intervals. The whole thing is about 1cm square.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apjUxk3lKCc<br>
                http://www.3ders.org/articles/20170105-tiny-3d-printed-biobots-could-dispense-drug-doses-from-inside-your-body.html</p>


                <p class="subtitle">ROBOTICS</p>

                <p>Youtube user, TheAmazel uploaded a video showing a Pepper robot's arm and hand being controlled remotely using a leap motion controller. Pretty cool, considering you can pick up a second hand Leap for very cheap.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZtqlvxcVCo</p>

                <p>PALRobotics also demonstrated their humanoid robot that has full body balancing. Looks a bit creepy how the robot is staring the guy in the eyes like a defenseless puppy, while he's pulling it about.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqxTov7isio</p>

                <p>As well as that, YouBionic unvieled their open source bionic hand, which uses a combination of 3D printing and off-the-shelf components like arduinos.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">DRONES</p>

                <p>Urban Aero recently completed the first successful autonomous flight test of the Cormorant UAV, a giant drone thing, which is capable of carrying people onboard. This looks like is belong in a Halo game or something.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PByFlMyAYpg</p>


                <p class="subtitle">VIDEOS</p>

                <p>The first video this week is a TED talk by Kevin Kelly, the founding editor of Wired, where he talks about artificial intelligence, and how he feels we'll have more of a collaborative, and less adversarial relationship with AI.</p>

                <p>Motherboard also made a post about their best documentaries of 2016 recently, many of which have been featured here.</p>

                <p>Alright, that's it for this week. Thanks for watching.</p>
