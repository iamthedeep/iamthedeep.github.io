                <p>Welcome to Cyber Dump number 10. This is your weekly roundup of what&#39;s happening in this insane age of technology that we live in. As always, all sources are below.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</p>

                <p>I mentioned a few weeks ago that Deepmind&#39;s AlphaGo program beat one of the best Go players in the world, well it now has taken on Lee Se-dol, who is apparently THE best Go player on the planet . With $1million on the line, the AI has won the first 2 of 5 games played, with the rest taking place in the next few days.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">EXO SKELETONS</p>

                <p>3D printer makers ZMorph did an interesting writeup showing how they designed and made a fully 3D printed rehabilitation orthosis which allows people to use their limbs when they are weak or damaged.</p>

                <p>- http://blog.zmorph3d.com/3d-printed-rehabilitation-orthosis/</p>

                <p>In other exo skeleton news, researchers at Columbia&#39;s School of Engineering have designed a powered exo skeleton aimed at those with scoliosis and other spine problems. Users can bend and turn, while still supporting their spines, which is a big difference compared to the hard, rigid braces most patients have to wear.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">CRYPTO</p>

                <p>Let&#39;s Encrypt reached a cool milestone this week by issuing it&#39;s millionth free SSL certificate.</p>

                <p>- https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/03/lets-encrypt-has-issued-million-certificates</p>

                <p>Cryptomator, the project that gives users free client-side encryption for cloud stored files also officially came out of beta this week. I definitely want to learn more about this project.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">NO MAPS FOR THESE TERRITORIES</p>

                <p>Nominet, the UK&#39;s domain name registry released an interesting infographic showing the distribution of country specific domain names across the world. It looks quite a bit different to how I would have guessed. Really eye opening.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">SELF-DRIVING CARS</p>

                <p>Tinkerer Jason Hughes was poking around in the firmware of a Tesla Model S, when he found references to a new unreleased model, the P100D. The interesting thing is that when he posted about this on twitter, Tesla tried to remotely downgrade the firmware in his car.</p>

                <p>The fact that many new cars have accessible firmware, and that it can be altered remotely, should make people pause for thought, and I expect there will lots of hacking and craziness with these cars in the future.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">DIY</p>

                <p>Tindie opened their flea market for hardware hackers and tinkerers. The idea is for people to sell their cheap electronics and tools that may be gathering dust. It&#39;s pretty empty at the minute, but I look forward to seeing how it develops.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">BITCOIN</p>

                <p>Speaking of marketplaces, Open Bazaar, the decentralized, bitcoin powered Ebay alternative is currently in Beta testing. This quick overview video explores the current state of the project, and it looks like it&#39;ll be released soon.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">BIOHACKING</p>

                <p>The Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne have designed a bionic fingertip that can help amputees feel whether surfaces they touch are smooth or rough. It&#39;s signal is broadcasted directly to nerve endings in the arm, meaning it can also work on non-amputees too. Imagine combining this with augmented or virtual reality to “feel” the worlds you inhabit.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">VIDEOS</p>

                <p>The first video this week is a Steam VR Developer roundtable, where a bunch of prominent game developers discuss ideas and the challenges of developing for virtual reality.</p>

                <p>- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8D3eoMII-w</p>

                <p>The next is a cool DIY video that didn&#39;t really fit anywhere else. It shows you how to turn a USB air purifier into a static electricity generator.</p>

                <p>- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5za9sa4-qk</p>

                <p>I&#39;ve been busy this week, so no new udpates on the NODE channel. There should hopefully be some more next week though. In the meantime, thanks for watching.</p>
