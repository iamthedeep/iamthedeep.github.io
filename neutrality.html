                DECENTRALIZATION, NEUTRALITY AND FAIRNESS<br>
                --
                </div>


                <div id="post">
                <p>The recent snowballing of new decentralized technologies is shaping how we interact with each other in unprecedented ways, and one particular aspect that I am very excited by is it’s role in fairness.</p>

                <p>There obviously are many unfair things in the world, most of them revolving around arbitrary rules and permissions granted or denied by centralized parties. A lot of the time we just happen to be born into these systems and have no real say on how they operate.</p>

                <p>Although technology is inherently neutral in that it doesn’t care who uses it, this inversely leads to a level of fairness which I think is pretty new to our species.</p>


                <p class="subtitle">REAL EQUALITY</p>

                <p>Equality is one of those words which gets banded around, and like many other labels in language, gets misused. One persons version of equality may be completely different to someone else - often meaning preferential treatment for their particular group or section of society.</p>

                <p>Real equality on the other hand - such as with Bitcoin - adds a whole new dimension to the word. Since the technology is completely neutral, that means there is absolute equality for every single human being who wants to use it. It doesn’t care about your nationality, your race, your gender, how much money you have, what job you have, what your political (or non-political) ideas are, or whether you’re a good or bad person. It only sees you as a potential user. As long as you have access to the network and your private keys to prove ownership, then there is absolutely no-one who can stop anyone interacting with anyone else. Think about those in developing countries who are currently unable to get a bank account. Hell, even in ‘developed’ countries, ordinary people are often denied the ability to transact through the banking system, due to a range of circumstances like nationality, immigration status, employment status, credit history and other arbitrary rules. If you remove the gatekeepers, you level the playing field, in a real tangible way.</p>


                <p class="subtitle">NO FORCE INVOLVED</p>

                <p>The idea is to marry those two points of virtual space and bandwidth in such a way that users can be rewarded with real cryptocurrency in exchange for helping run the system.</p>

                <p>Like Dekorte mentioned the other day, you could have a grid system whereby every piece of digital space is available for purchase. It could be much like Namecoin in that you have to buy your domain (in both senses of the word). This first barrier of actually having to put money up to build you&#39;re own space should stop spammers from taking up all the unused space right away.</p>

                <p>Added to that, you could have a grace period for unused land where other users would be able to also bid on the space. This could lead to interesting things since VR space is infinite, you could have users band together and set up their own digital cities far away from the original base in order to buy cheaper, much like in the real world. Also like in the real world, you&#39;d open up entirely new private property markets in which property owners who have interesting buildings or valuable locations could sell privately (with bitcoin) to the highest bidder.</p>

                <p>Another similarity to Namecoin is that you could introduce a renewal fee, so every so often (maybe once a year) you have to pay a fee to renew your space. If you fail to do so, your record is wiped from the blockchain and the space is available again. This serves as a good way to verify you are still active and could stop hoarders.</p>

                <p>Now the interesting part is where all those Bitcoins would go. You could set up some kind of multisig escrow system that no one person or group can control, and these would be funds for the entire system. They&#39;d be paid out in set intervals in a sort of lottery to the users who share the most bandwidth with the most users, so those who help run the system (and increase the experience for everyone) would be rewarded. The (significant) challenge here would be verifying this.</p>
