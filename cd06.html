                <p class="subtitle">KEYBASE FILESYSTEM</p>

                <p>Keybase announced that they have started testing their new file storage service. Unlike Dropbox, Google Drive and the rest, Keybase actually seems to care about privacy and security for the users, so this comes with some awesome features. For example, when you upload a file, it&#39;s automatically signed with your public key. You also have a private folder that encrypts anything inside it, and importantly, only you hold the keys.</p>

                <p>The filesystem also makes use of the bitcoin blockchain for the key management.</p>

                <p>Each user gets 10GB of storage, and alpha testing is currently ongoing.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">SINGLE BOARD COMPUTING</p>

                <p>HardKernel have announced some details on their new Raspberry Pi 2 competitor, the Odroid-C2. Following the same formfactor as the Pi, this 64-bit board has a 2Ghz quad core CPU, 2GB of RAM, 4k HDMI output, 47 GPIO pins, an infrared receiver and more. It even comes with it&#39;s own heatsink, so no need to buy a separate one.</p>

                <p>As a past Odroid user, I definitely look forward to seeing what this is capable of. It goes on sale March 2nd for $40.</p>

                <p>In more SBC news, Erle Robotics recently announced the PXFMini shield for the Raspberry Pi Zero. This little board is designed specifically for embedded drone and robotics projects. It&#39;s packed with servo outputs, tonnes of sensors, 4 battery connectors, and is currently available for â‚¬69.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">OS X VULNERABILITY</p>

                <p>Researchers have found a potentially massive vulnerability which effects lots of Mac apps, including popular software Camtasia, uTorrent and VLC Player amongst others.</p>

                <p>It&#39;s to do with a security hole in the Sparkle framework that many apps use to handle updates, and allows attackers to inject malicious code when users check for updates. At present, there&#39;s no blanket fix, and the advice given is to avoid unsecured WiFi and untrusted networks.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">VIRTUAL REALITY</p>

                <p>Youtube user DoctorNoob uploaded a video showing the alpha version of the Revolvr VR controller. It consists of a trigger with two LEDs on the back, red for when the trigger is pressed and blue for when it&#39;s not.</p>

                <p>Intended for use with smartphone based VR headsets like Google Cardboard, the tracking is all done using the phones camera, and this makes for a really cheap and effective way to have precise motion tracking.</p>

                <p>Outside of games, I could see this working well for navigating virtual reality interfaces.</p>

                <p>The Revolvr is being launched as an IndieGoGo campaign at the end of the month.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">AUGMENTED REALITY</p>

                <p>Randori Digital Climbing uploaded a new video of their augmented reality rock climbing game held at Brooklyn Boulders Somerville. This one&#39;s not too crazy in terms of the technology used, but it&#39;s another example of how screens, headsets and projectors are playing an ever-increasing part in our lives - plus it looks pretty fun.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">FLASH DRIVES</p>

                <p>Flash Drives for Freedom is an organization which aims to open the eyes of people living in North Korea, by smuggling in subversive information on USB drives. Curated by North Korean defectors, the drives contain a wide range of information, from South Korean soap operas, to Hollywood films, to wikipedia entries and interviews with other defectors.</p>

                <p>The collaborative effort between the Human Rights Foundation and Forum 280 are currently looking for donations of peoples unused flash drives. Obviously secure wipe your drive before you send anything, you don&#39;t want the dear leader coming after you!</p>

                <p class="subtitle">VIDEOS</p>

                <p>The first video this week a really well done, concise overview of the maths behind some forms of encryption.</p>

                <p>Github also uploaded tonnes of videos from their Github Universe 2015 event, featuring lots of talks on open source ideas and collaborative projects. Well worth a look.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">THIS WEEK ON NODE</p>

                <p>Added a few more products to the NODE shop this week, including a circuit symbols tee, customizable PGP stickers, and a simple privacy sticker.</p>

                <p>- http://N-O-D-E.net/shop/</p>

                <p>I also showed you how to make a really tiny USB on-the-go adaptor, perfect for Android devices and raspberry pi zero. The second vid is an overview of how to set up Firefox for increased privacy and security.</p>
