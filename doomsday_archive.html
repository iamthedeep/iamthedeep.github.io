                SOLAR-POWERED DOOMSDAY ARCHIVE [APOCALYPSE SERIES]<br>
                --
                </div>


                <div id="post">
                <p>One thing I&#39;ve often thought about after watching countless Walking Dead episodes is how crucial technology and information is to civilization. What if it all went down in flames one day? How would we function without access to the internet?</p>

                <p>That&#39;s why I made this little prototype. I call it the doomsday archive, and the idea is to store a bunch of important information, in order to survive and rebuild, if some awful, world changing scenario ever happened.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">DESIGN</p>

                <p>The prototype is made from an old Kindle 4, a piratebox wifi filesharing board, a solar charger and battery, all which are cheap and readily available.</p>

                <p>The are also three switches on the back, allowing you to chose which devices can be powered, as well as an LED torch that can be toggled on and off. The indicator lights display when the solar panel is charging, and also how much of the battery remains.</p>


                <p class="subtitle">SIZE / WEIGHT</p>

                <p>The doomsday archive could have been smaller, but as I wanted to accomadate a slightly bigger solar panel on the back, it ended up being about the size of a medium hardback book.</p>

                <p>It weighs about 500 grams, and feels pretty comfortable being used by one or both hands.</p>


                <p class="subtitle">LOW POWER</p>

                <p>I chose the Kindle over a phone or tablet, because of the low powered e-ink display, and the low cost. The standard 4th gen Kindle has a 750mah battery, which gets about 1 months worth of reading, at 30mins a day. The piratebox board also has very low power consumption.</p>

                <p>Now combine that with the 4000mah battery, and you can see that this could potentially last a very long time.</p>

                <p>The 2.5w 500ma solar panel allows you to trickle charge this big battery. This takes a few days in direct sunlight, which isn&#39;t the fastest, but it does allow you to be completely off the grid.</p>

                <p>I scavanged the charging circuit and battery from a cheap mini solar charger, and this also means you can use the device as a standard USB solar charger for powering other devices too.</p>


                <p class="subtitle">WEATHERPROOF(ISH)</p>

                <p>I added a bunch of rubber and foam to the inside and outside to hopefully protect the components.</p>

                <p>You could also put it in a couple of ziplock bags as a quick way to waterproof it. Since the Kindle has tacticle buttons, you can still use it without any problems.</p>


                <p class="subtitle">INFORMATION</p>

                <p>Information is what this is all about. The idea is for it to contain all important information about how to survive and thrive when things start falling apart. </p>

                <p>This means the kindle is packed full of ebooks and PDFs on topics like generating electricity, growing food, gathering water, communicating, medical procedures, textbooks, general DIY help and more. There&#39;s also more information aimed at long term rebuilding such as philosophy, history, math, science, engineering and culture.</p>

                <p>The piratebox has copies of all of this, plus more such as individual guides, videos, images, maps etc that may be useful. It also includes files and instructions for how to build communications networks, mesh networks etc, with the relevant install files needed, and it is accessed using the Kindle&#39;s web browser.</p>

                <p>The beauty about the piratebox is that as you grow, more information can be added, and more people and devices can both upload and download information wirelessly, building and replicating this knowledge.</p>


                <p class="subtitle">CONCLUSION</p>

                <p>So that is the doomsday archive. I&#39;m pretty happy with how it turned out. What do you think? How could it be improved? Thanks for watching.</p>
