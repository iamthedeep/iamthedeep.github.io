                <p class="subtitle">BREACHES</p>

                <p>A laptop used by a Navy IT contractor was recently hacked, exposing sensitive data including social security numbers of about 130,000 Navy personnel. A spokesman said that those affected will be notified in the coming weeks.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">COMMUNICATION</p>

                <p>Riot announced that the latest version of their decentralized, cross-platform chat app now has end-to-end encryption built in, meaning room admins now have the ability to increase the privacy of users.</p>

                http://riot.im</p>

                <p>The Tor Project also pushed out a new release of their Tor Messenger app this week too. Have any of you tried either of these chat apps? What are your thoughts?</p>

                <p class="subtitle">HACKING</p>

                <p>Blackhat uploaded a tonne of new videos from their latest conference, Black Hat USA 2016. As always, there are many different topics covered to get your neurons firing.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/user/BlackHatOfficialYT/videos</p>


                <p class="subtitle">WIFI</p>

                <p>Kaspersky Lab created a report on the security of wireless networks around the globe, according to their security network database. They found that of the 32 million access points assessed, roughly Â¼ of them are completely open, without any form of encryption. It also drills down into the types of encryption used, and distribution around the world. Well worth a read.</p>

                <p>https://securelist.com/blog/research/76733/research-on-unsecured-wi-fi-networks-across-the-world/</p>

                <p>And speaking of unsecured networks, AndroidAuthority on Youtube, released a good 101 video about the different ways someone could go about capturing data on open wifi hotspots.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">INTERNET OF FAILS</p>

                <p>On the back of all the IP camera fails I&#39;ve covered recently, a new serious vulnerability has been found in Siemens-branded CCTV cameras, used widely by government and healthcare organizations. </p>

                <p>A careful crafted request can be exploited remotely, revealing admin credentials, and leading to access. A patch has been released, but it requires individual camera operators to apply it manually. </p>

                <p class="subtitle">VULNERABILITIES</p>

                <p>Another day, another massive Android vulnerability, this time, affecting almost 3 million Chinese handsets. Similar to something I covered in an earlier episode, researchers found a hidden binary responsible for software updates, which can be taken advantage of using a man in the middle attack, allowing attackers to install and run, anything they like.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">PRIVACY</p>

                <p>Researchers at Ben Gurion University showed off a way to turn headphones into microphones, for audio surveillance. This is due to the widely used Realtek audio codec chip, which allows attackers to change audio output to audio input.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">BIG DATA</p>

                <p>And finally, Bloomberg reports that some financial insitutions have begun using phone data, like location, call and browsing habits, to determine whether people who don&#39;t have credit histories are allowed or denied loans. </p>

                <p>This opens up the possibility of being pre-declined for loans, just by virtue of where you live, who you know, and what your interests are.</p>
